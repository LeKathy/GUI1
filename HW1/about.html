            My name is Kathy Le. I was born and raised in Boston, MA. I currently 
            study at University of Massachusetts Lowell, with the major of Computer Science 
            and minor in Graphic Design. The pronouns I go by are She/Her/Hers/Them/They. 
            I am a Vietnamese-American female. Exciting as a crowded house may get, the attention
        I get from being the middle child of five is a good fit for me.</p>
